Configuring ORBit
-----------------

ORBit must be configured to NOT use its own accelerated transport, but 
instead, the standard IIOP. This is a little tricky. We do this by 
editing the file: /etc/orbitrc and make sure it contains:

ORBIIOPIPv4=1
ORBIIOPIPv6=1
ORBIIOPUSock=0

This could alternatively be located at /usr/etc/orbitrc, or 
/usr/local/etc/orbitrc, depending on how ORBit has been configured
